These short sessions (45min to 1hr) will be focused on R, RStudio and GitHub tools and practices for NOAA scientists to help you be **faster, more efficient and organized**. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools; they are intended to get you applying the skill immediately in your own work. I will give you links to my and other NOAA GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (that you can copy and build on).

**Target audience**: This year I am assuming that you have an understanding of using Git and GitHub. See the [RWorflow Workshops 2022](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/) if not. All sessions (except last) were recorded. The 2023 sessions are in preparation for a hackathon I am teaching in Sept 2023 on Species Distribution Modeling for marine systems. 

**About the instructor Eli Holmes**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research and am heavily involved in efforts to support transition to Open Science workflows within NOAA Fisheries.
