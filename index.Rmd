In 2023, I am focusing on Part 1) cloud computing platforms and Part 2) working with remote-sensing data in R. Why cloud computing? Well the days of doing all your work on a computer with all your software downloaded to that are numbered. It is not a very efficient way to work. It is more efficient to have everyone working on a fully provisioned platform so you can focus on the science and not the software installation headaches. Part 2) is because I am preparing for a couple oceanography hackweeks in late summer. The focus of these workshops is practical skills and tools; they are intended to get you applying the skill immediately in your own work. I will give you links to my and other NOAA GitHub repositories that illustrate more complex examples (that you can copy and build on).

**Target audience**: This year I am assuming that you have an understanding of using Git and GitHub. See the [RWorflow Workshops 2022](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2022/) if not. All sessions (except last) were recorded.

**About the instructor Eli Holmes**: I am a modeler/applied mathematician. I develop R packages for public use. I teach time-series analysis at the University of Washington (using R) and I teach workshops on R and reproducible research and am heavily involved in efforts to support transition to Open Science workflows within NOAA Fisheries.
